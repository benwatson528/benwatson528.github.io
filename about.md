Hi my name is Ben Watson. I'm an experienced modern data platform lead with extensive big data experience. I'm based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and I provide data solutions to companies throughout the UK. I spend most of my time these days building Nando's modern data platform using GCP BigQuery and associated tools such as Dataform and Looker.

In my spare time I enjoy gradually getting worse at basketball and the guitar.

Free free to say hi to me onÂ <a title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-watson-big-data">LinkedIn</a>.
